## Introduction

On 15 December 2015, British astronaut Tim Peake set off on the Principia mission to the International Space Station which is in orbit around Earth. This project ties in with the The Principia Space Diary, a free resource for UK schools, produced as part of European Space Agency Astronaut Tim Peake’s Principia Mission. For more information about the Space Diary, visit [http://principiaspacediary.org](http://principiaspacediary.org).

You are going to create your own space quiz using facts about your body in space. This quiz is based on the activity on page 6 of the Space Diary.
